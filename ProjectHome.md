The Flodin Framework is an inituitive, easy to use framework for iOS development with DragonFireSDK. If you've ever used DFSDK, you know that it could easily be expanded upon, as it basically gives you the iOS SDK for Windows. However, though, other frameworks may differ too much from the bare-bones that the DragonFireSDK gives you, and they're too hard too learn. This is the exact opposite. You could create an entire application just like you would with the original DragonFireSDK, only this gives you options. It automates the Build.zip file creation, creating a new copy every time you debug your project on your PC. It adds a plethora of new functions, used for everything from easily creating files to getting the iDevice's internal clock times. You have the power to make any app that you want, and it's all free.

Some of the functions that this framework incorporates:

-Getting the iDevice's internal clock times

-Converting degrees to radians and vice versa

-Finding the distance between two points on a 2D grid

-Easily reading from and writing to locally stored files

-Simple variable converters


The number of functions, classes, and time-savers will continue to grow as my programming knowledge does, and hopefully you will have as much fun using this framework as I did creating it.

UPDATE: The first beta release is now available! Go to the "Downloads" section of this repository to download the version 1.0 beta.
